Enyo UI tests

## Getting Started

### Run Tests on one browser

```
grunt test:sauce:chrome
grunt test:sauce:firefox
grunt test:sauce:explorer
```

### Run Parallel Tests

```
grunt test:sauce:parallel
```

## Documentation
If you want to run tests locally then you will need to set up a server to serve the source files and you will need to set up [Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/).

These tests are intended to be run as a Travis CI task.

## Examples
_(Coming soon)_

## Contributing
Please see the [style guide](http://enyojs.com/docs/latest/best-practices/style-guide.html).

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the "lib" subdirectory!_
